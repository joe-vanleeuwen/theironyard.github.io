### Skilled artisans have redefined America’s craft scene.

Indie Craft Parade is a public market that brings together many of the best artists and their handmade goods from across the Southeast. For three days, you'll enjoy quality crafts, local food, and the opportunity to make friends and connections with the artists themselves.

### The Event

This event welcomes independent artists and anyone interested in purchasing unique handcrafted goods from within their own communities.All regional crafters and artisans are encouraged to submit their work for consideration.

### Our Vision

In a public market that promotes quality crafts, Indie Craft Parade brings together the best artists in the Southeast and encourages interaction between the community and local independent artists.

Each year talented musicians and local food vendors are also invited to contribute to the vibrant atmosphere of the festivities.

Indie Craft Parade seeks to enrich every day life by spreading good art and design throughout the community, promoting the belief that art is both personal and powerful.
