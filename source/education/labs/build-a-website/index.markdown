### Website Basics: HTML and CSS

In our after school website class, students learn internet fundamentals, how the browser works, and the basics of building things for the web. While gaining a working knowledge of both markup and CSS, kids will craft their very own website. (You'll have to print it out to put it on the fridge, mom and dad.)

## FAQ

#### My child is younger than 13. Is there any way he/she can take the class?

If your child has completed CoderDojo Scratch, CoderDojo Electronics, or both, they may take this course. We don't accept students younger than 8 years old.

#### I registered interest in a full class. How will I know if my child gets in?

If a student in a full class drops out before the course starts, we will give their spot to those who registered interest on a first-come-first serve basis. 

#### Do I need to sign any legal paperwork in order for my child to take the class? 

We require every student to have a waiver/release form signed by a parent or guardian. You will recieve a link to this form when you sign up for a ticket.
